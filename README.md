# About me

![My Image](Rodolfo.png)

My name is Rodolfo Javier Meneses Leal, I’m an international student from Costa Rica, back in my country I have 3 years now on my Computer Science career, this is my fourth year and I wanted to take the challenge of completing some courses here in New Paltz, I know it might be difficult, but I’ll try my best. Back in my Home country university I took these courses: Programming I, II, III and IV, Databases I and II, Discrete Structures, Operating System,Computer Architecture, I’m also taking independently a self-paced course called CS50 from Harvard, about all the fundamentals of programming.

Maybe the biggest project I’ve had the chance to work on was last semester, using JavaServerFaces, PrimeFaces, HTML and SQL to create a website to store, review, edit and visualize food recipes, but since our professor focused on PrimeFaces we didn’t have the chance to manipulate CSS too much, since the elements of PrimeFaces are ready just copy paste into your code. Using what i'll learn from this course I see myself creating websites for little businesses in my country, and start building more experience from there.
